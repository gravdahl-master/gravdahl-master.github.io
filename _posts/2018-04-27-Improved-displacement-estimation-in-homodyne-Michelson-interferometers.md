Interferometry can be used to measure length displacements with high accuracy and resolution. Measuring length using interferometry relates the measurement directly to the definition of the meter, via the frequency $\omega = 2 \pi f$, or wavelength $\lambda$, of the laser source used, since the two are related by $\lambda = c/f$, where $c$ is the speed of light in vacuum. The accuracy of the measurement is therefore in principle only limited by how well the frequency of the laser source can be determined.

Displacement measurement using optical interferometry is mainly done using variants of the Michelson interferometer, using highly coherent and polarized light from a laser source. Resolution below 1 nm is routinely achieved in suitable environmental conditions, but the accuracy of the measurements are impacted due to several non-ideal effects. **Improved estimation methods can rectify these accuracy problems.**
