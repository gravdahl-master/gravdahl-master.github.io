# AFM probing usage for cell mechanics #

Background

Atomic Force microscopy (AFM) is becoming a prevalent tool in cell biology and biomedical studies, especially those focusing on the mechanical properties of cells and tissues. As a unique feature with respect to other bionanotools, AFM provides nanometer-resolution maps for cell topography, stiffness, viscoelasticity, and adhesion, often overlaid with matching optical images of the probed cells. This project is intended for those about to embark in the use of bio-AFMs, and aims to assist them in designing an experiment to measure the mechanical properties of adherent cells. In addition to describing the main steps in a typical cell mechanics protocol and explaining how data is analysed.

Assignment
The project consists of the following tasks:
*	Explore and analyse the key elements and operating principles of current AFMs
*	Explore and choose the optimal working conditions for a cell mechanics experiment. Implement a method that will be used as a guide on what are the needed steps to be followed in order to be able to use the AFM for the inspection of biological samples. i.e. cantilever stiffness and the probing depth etc.
*	Simulations will be performed in order to prove that the proposed techniques can be applicable and to show that the results are on the correct route.
