# Control of two air cushions on a Surface Effect Ship for damping of roll motion#

### for Accessing Offshore Windturbines ###

Basert på et nylig utført [PhD-arbeid](http://www.ntnu.no/ansatte/auestad) (se også artikkel i [TU](http://www.tu.no/industri/2013/10/22/den-leser-bolger-og-har-en-toppfart-pa-over-40-knop)) Samarbeidende bedrift: [Umoe Mandal](http://www.um.no/).

Main superviser: Jan Tommy Gravdahl.
Co-superviser: Vahid Hassani, Øyvind Auestad and potentially Vidar Tregde or Sverre Steen for the hydrodynamic part.

1. Develop a new SES design, together with Umoe Mandal,  with two air cushions. The cushions will be divided along the center-line, either by using a fixed hull or a flexible rubber seal design. Regardless, the design needs to seal the two air cushions, hence no, or small air leak between port and starboard air cushion.
2. Develop a mathematical model describing these dynamics. The mathematical model should be divided into a process plant model (for a comprehensive, realistic SES Simulator) and a control plant model (for control system design and stability analysis).
3. (Utvidelse til masteroppgave) Model-test the controller and the design in the spring of 2017. We can perform hull modifications to the alerady existing 3m long Wave Craft.
