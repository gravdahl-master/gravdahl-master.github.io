# Robust control of MEMS gyroscope #

Background

MEMS gyroscopes have become the most growing microsensors in recent years due to the characteristics of compact size, low cost, and high sensitivity. Most MEMS gyroscopes sales in the market are vibrating silicon micromechanical gyroscopes, whose basic principle is to generate and detect Coriolis Effect. In the last few years, numerous advanced control approaches with intelligent design have been studied to realize the trajectory tracking and to handle the system parametric uncertainties and disturbances, and the adaptive control can be found in the literature.Â 


Assignment

The project consists of the following tasks:
* Modelling of the mems gyroscope with structural parametric uncertainties included in the model.
* Creation of a robust control scheme that will include the uncertainties in the controller design. 
* Simulations will be performed to prove the efficiency of the proposed control scheme.
