Several assignemnts possible:

### Model Predictive Control for targeted observations ###
### Dynamical modeling and nonlinear control for formation flying of SmallSats ###
* Linear (optimal control)
* Nonlinear (model predictive)
* Solving two-point boundary value problems using generating functions and its applications in the design of spacecraft formation trajectories, reconfiguration and formation keeping

### SmallSat Reaction wheel design and simulations for pointing and slew maneuver ###

The student will investigate rigorous reaction wheel design and energy management for CubeSats (1-12U size) where it takes the limitation of size and mass into consideration. There are two applications to be investigated: 1) slewing maneuver towards a target on ground; and 2) pointing of CubeSat towards a point target. Since CubeSats may not achieve as high pointing and slew maneuver accuracy as larger satellites (i.e. these have higher inertia, more sensors and more accurate orbit knowledge compared to small satellites), it is suggested that the student will find solutions to minimize the perturbing effects of random noise, jittering and micro-vibrations directly related to structure, sensors and subsystems. In-orbit perturbations (J2 effects, drag, solar radiation pressure etc.) and momentum dumping with magnetic torquers will also be incorporated in this work. Furthermore, it is envisaged that the student will perform rigid body spacecraft simulations with a) model predictive control, b) passivity-based sliding surface controller c) other nonlinear controllers upon choice as well as building dummy reaction wheels, implementing controllers for practical testing to demonstrate theory-in-practice. 
### Attitude determination and control for hyperspectral imaging ###
* Jittering
* Motion blur
* Pixel co-registration
* System identification for SmallSat
* Multi-agent intelligent control for an architecture of SmallSats, UAVs, USVs and AUVs
