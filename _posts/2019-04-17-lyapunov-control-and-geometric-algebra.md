From the beginning of our studies we are spoon fed Lyapunov control. In this project you will explore these techniques in an alternative algebra to our classical linear algebra. If you've ever wondered what quaternions truly _are_[^1], how to transform planes like you can transform reference frames, or how to create control theory for transforming lines just as easily as points, then conformal geometric algebra may have the answers. Conformal geometric algebra starts with the idea of the geometric product. There is a github group[^2] exploring geometric algebra with python modules for numerical evaluation[^3], symbolic evaluation[^4], and a Javascript-based visualizer[^5].

In this project you will investigate conformal geometric algebra and look at using Lyapunov control to design controllers for problems that use the algebra. This will allow you to explore an up and coming geometrical modeling system with classical control theory. Using this, we will look to simplify methods of controlling robots, figuring out better forward kinematics models, or control geometric items as they are rather than shallow interpretations of them. 


## Prerequisites ##

1. Interest in Lyapunov control theory
2. Strong mathematical understanding

## Tasks ##

1. Literature survey of conformal geometric algebra as applied to robotics
1. Investigate conformal geometric algebra (and geometric calculus)
2. Apply the methods to Lyapunov control

## Further work ##

Almost all robotics tasks are concerned with geometrical problems, we can easily find applicable experiments if time permits.
