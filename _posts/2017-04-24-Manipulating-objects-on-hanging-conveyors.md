# Manipulating objects on hanging conveyors #

### Background ###
Manipulating objects on a conveyor requires a robot to be able to interact with moving objects even though there is uncertainty in the relative motion/position between the robot and the object. This requires dynamic interaction control with motion estimation, which represents a paradigm shift in industrial automation. 

### Assignment ###
The project consists of the following tasks:
* Survey the literature for proposed solutions to interaction with moving objects using robot manipulators. Focus particularly on optimal reference trajectory generation, but also on other aspects such as real-time state estimation techniques, identification of unknown model parameters, variable admittance control, etc.
* Develop and implement a learning based model predictive path planner for reference trajectory generation with the purpose of loading an object onto a conveyer. Make a comparison with other relevant methods in the literature. Important aspects is how to approach the conveyer, how to achieve contact, at which force etc.
