# Design of an operator support system for a SES using onboard measurements #

A surface effect ship (SES) is a marine vehicle with a catamaran type hull and flexible rubber seals in the bow and stern end to enclose an air cushion that have high speed and superior sea keeping performance in high sea states compared to conventional catamarans [1]. SES is equipped with a lift system consisting of lift fans, and Vent Valves (VV) where the set of lift fans blow air into the air cushion with constant speed to pressurize it where the opening of the VV are controlled to generate desired lift which can carry close to 80% of the ships mass during transit. 

Umoe Mandal is currently the only shipyard in the world that launches SES. The shipyard has delivered several SES to the Norwegian Navy, such as the MTB Skjold class and the Mine Countermeasure Vessels (MCMV) series. Recently, the yard has focused on providing SES (WAVECRAFT) to the offshore wind industry.

A Platform management system (PMS) on a commercial vessel often displays a high number of signals. Overloading the operator with a huge amount of information on the PMS increases the probability of human error. Furthermore, when an alarm goes off, it is often too late in terms system recovery or even in some cases, safety aspects can be compromised. This thesis aims at designing an operator support systems that could analyze the measured data in real-time and provide only the necessary information that operator needs to know (including fault detections).

The project unfolds in two parts: in part one, model based fault detection methodologies will be investigated. To this end, the measured signals are continuously compared with the numerically predicted values (based on developed models) and any possible deviation would be studied for possible fault alarm. Part two will focus more on pure data mining techniques such as Classification, Clustering, Sequential patterns recognition, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) etc.

The actual data-set will be provided by Umoe Mandal.

The work will be supervised by  Professor Jan Tommy Gravdahl from Department of Engineering Cybernetics Adj. Associate professor Vahid Hassani from Department of Marine Technology, and Dr. Øyvind Auestad from Umoe Mandal.
