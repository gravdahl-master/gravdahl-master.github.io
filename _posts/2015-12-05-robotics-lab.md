# Robotics Lab #
### Setup, Analysis and Control of an Industrial Robotics Lab ###
The robotics lab situated in the basement of the D-block is ready for a technological overhaul. The task is to interface two KUKA KR16 robots with a real-time linux setup and evaluate the usefulness of this lab.

#### Open Source ####
The approach to the setup of the robotics lab will be mainly focused on using open-source software. There are many different robotic software platforms available to researchers. And your choices of which to use will be guiding for other researchers in the future. Links of interest: [ROS-industrial](http://rosindustrial.org/)

#### Setup Limitations ####
To facilitate future projects in the lab, it is important to find accurate descriptions of what one can do with the current lab setup. This means evaluating communication latency, the limitations of the software used, and what you think must be developed in the future.
