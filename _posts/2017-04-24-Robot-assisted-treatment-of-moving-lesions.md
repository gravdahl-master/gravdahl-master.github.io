# Robot assisted treatment of moving lesions #

### Background ###

In healthcare, there are several lesions that are treated with non-invasive methods, or by minimally invasive techniques. Robotic systems may be used for treatment, but the automation of tasks is difficult because of movements of the patient or movement of organs due to the cardiac cycle or respiration. The future autonomous surgical robots requires the development of methods that can segment moving objects in medical images or video, estimate the motion and path of the moving object, and compensate or account for the motion by the robotic arm. High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU), used for pulverizing kidney stones, requires identifying features in an image and compensating for the movement of the body (due to respiration) in order direct the focused beam on the kidney stone with minimal exposure to surrounding tissue.

### Assignment ###

The project consists of the following tasks:

*	Survey the literature for real-time extraction, estimation and tracking of features from medical ultrasound images and video images
*	Implement a method of choice for real-time estimation and prediction based on dataset from e.g. http://www.custusx.org/index.php . Alternatively, use the method on estimation and prediction of moving human limbs recorded using a 3D sensor such as https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinect .
*	Develop a method for real-time motion compensation of robotic manipulators based on the predicted movement from images.
