# NTNU Test Satellite â€“ NUTS: #
As a part of the national student satellite program, the NUTS CubeSat project was initiated at NTNU in 2010. 
The projects goal is to give hands-on experience to students within different fields of satellite technology. 
This includes planning, specification, design, construction, launch and operation of a satellite.
The construction of a satellite is a multi-disciplinary field. To succeed, the project needs highly 
motivated and interested students with a different backgrounds. This technical complex project will 
serve as a challenge for all persons involved.
 
The main parts of the satellite bus are:
 
* Power system (solar cells and batteries)
* Attitude and orbit control
* Mechanical system (structures and mechanisms)
* TT&C (telemetry, tracking and command)
* Thermal system
* On-board data handling/On Board Computer (OBC)
* Payload and experiment
 
All project members will be assigned their individual problem description. 
This final assignment text will be created together with the student, to fit both the project's needs and the student's fields of interest.
 
As we are a multidisciplinary group with project members from several departments, 
different types of team- and group work must be expected. It will be required that the student joins 
weekly meetings with the rest of the team (consisting of staff, other project/master students and other students) 
to share experience and knowledge.
