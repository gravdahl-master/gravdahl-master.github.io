# Background on NTNU Test Satellite – NUTS: #

As a part of the national student satellite program, the NUTS CubeSat project was initiated at NTNU in 2010. The projects goal is to give hands-on experience to students within different fields of satellite technology. This includes planning, specification, design, construction, launch and operation of a satellite.
The construction of a satellite is a multi-disciplinary field. To succeed, the project needs highly motivated and interested students with a different backgrounds. This technical complex project will serve as a challenge for all persons involved.
 
The main parts of the satellite bus are:
 
* Power system (solar cells and batteries)
* Attitude and orbit control
* Mechanical system (structures and mechanisms)
* TT&C (telemetry, tracking and command)
* Thermal system
* On-board data handling/On Board Computer (OBC)
* Payload and experiment
 
All project members will be assigned their individual problem description. This final assignment text will be created together with the student, to fit both the project's needs and the student's fields of interest.
 
As we are a multidisciplinary group with project members from several departments, different types of team- and group work must be expected. It will be required that the student joins weekly meetings with the rest of the team (consisting of staff, other project/master students and other students) to share experience and knowledge.
 

### ADCS – Attitude Determintation and Control System: ###
Orbit NTNU is building a small satellite that will be launched into low earth orbit. The satellite contains a attitude determination and control system which is being developed at NTNU.
The ADCS control algorithms are being tested on a hardware in the loop system which provides simulated environmental data such that the system can be properly tested.

A masters on this system can take their thesis is various directions. It is possible to improve the existing HIL simulation, use the HIL to test and verify the attitude controller or expand the hardware in the loop system to include other parts of the satellite such as the communication system, flight computer or the electrical power system.
