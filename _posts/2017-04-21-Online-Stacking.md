# Online stacking of heterogeneous parcels onto pallets #

![robotlab]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/robotlab1.jpg)

At wholesalers, boxes of different shapes are packed onto pallets. This is a high volume, work intensive area which is almost always done manually. A successful automation of these processes will require solving several technical challenges linked to parcel localization, grasping and stacking on a new pallet. In this project, it is proposed to investigate solutions for online stacking of heterogeneous parcels onto pallets. 

The issue of packing as efficiently as many parcels as possible in a given volume is an active research area. Surprisingly, the issue of stability, taking into account tilting of products is rarely ever mentioned. This is the issue we would like to investigate in this project, with a focus on online stacking of one or several given products on the current stack.
