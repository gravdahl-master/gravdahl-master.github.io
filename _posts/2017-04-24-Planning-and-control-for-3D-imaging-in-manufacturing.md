# Planning and control for 3D imaging in manufacturing #

### Background ###
To inspect the quality of parts in a manufacturing process, consider using a camera attached to the end-effector of a robotic manipulator. The robotic manipulator will either move the camera over the object, or move the object in front of the camera to create a 3D representation of the object which can then be compared with a known CAD model of the object. The main objective is to design planning and control algorithms for the motion of the end-effector (with the camera), such that a high quality 3D representation of the object is achieved.

### Assignment ###
The project consists of the following tasks:
*	Survey planning and control of robotic manipulators for inspection and imaging tasks. 
*	Design and implement a set-based control algorithm for the motion of the end-effector of the manipulator with the purpose of inspecting randomly placed objects. The algorithm should be evaluated with respect to completeness of the achieved 3D representation (coverage by the cameras field-of-view) quality of the achieved 3D representation (estimated accuracy of the representation based on for instance the imaging quality and accuracy of end-effector positioning) and efficiency (time consumption of the total planned motion). Consider also the efficiency of the algorithm with respect to a new object and CAD model.
