Orbit NTNU is building a small satellite that will be launched into low earth orbit. The satellite contains a attitude determination and control system which is being developed at NTNU.
The ADCS control algorithms are being tested on a hardware in the loop system which provides simulated environmental data such that the system can be properly tested.

A masters on this system can take their thesis is various directions. 
It is possible to improve the existing HIL simulation, use the HIL to test and verify the attitude controller or expand the hardware in the loop system to include other parts of the satellite such as the communication system, flight computer or the electrical power system.
