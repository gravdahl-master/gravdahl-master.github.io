# Attitude control and thrusters for small satellites #

NTNU has established a new research program that aims to bring forth payloads for small satellite systems for oceanographic applications. 
In the first phase, two payloads are foreseen; one communication payload based on Software Defined Radio (SDR) 
and one hyper spectral imager (HSI). Several project/master assignments are available both for the payloads and
planning of the overall missions. Project/master students will work in a team together with other research staff.

### Assignement: ###
If several small satellites are launched together, they can operate as a swarm or a constellation. 
Several concepts for deploying and controlling the satellite swarm exists, 
and some of these concepts requires the use of (micro) thrusters. 
The student should perform a (market) study on the availability and matureness of such thrusters. 
Requirements and constrains for the thrusters and the attitude determination and control systems must be identified and investigated. 
Simulations of the system is to be done.
