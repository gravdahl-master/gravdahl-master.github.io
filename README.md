# A Jekyll based projects blog for JTG

All posts are to be made in the _posts folder, with filename YYYY-MM-DD-filename.md. These will follow the markdown syntax specified in [markdown cheatsheet](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/heiswayi/the-plain/master/_posts/2015-09-04-markdown-cheatsheet-demo.md) (with example of how it looks [here](http://heiswayi.github.io/the-plain/notes/markdown-cheatsheet-demo/)).


## Credits
The theme is a badly lobotomized version of [the plain](http://heiswayi.github.io/the-plain.html) who has done great work.
